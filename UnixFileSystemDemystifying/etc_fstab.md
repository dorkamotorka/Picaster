## What is /etc/fstab?

fstab is a system's filesystem table, that is used to define a set of rules how different filesystems are treated each time they are introduced to a system.(e.g. when you plugin USB stick, should it be automatically mounted to the filesystem OR in case of Samba to automatically mount shared file system when detected)
