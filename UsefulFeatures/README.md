## Which Pi is which?

Since by looking at the Pi there is no indication of which Pi belongs to which IP, I had to do something about. 
Yes, potentially we could reboot one of the Pis and check whose Green light start going crazy but that is not a permanent solution. 

That's why I wrote a short bash script that blinks the green LED and such indicates on which Pi the script was run. The script can be found under:

	/scripts/blink.sh
